## v1.8.0 (16.05.2019)

### Enhancements

for file types.

Kudos to the first contributors!

## v1.4.0 (04.07.2018)

### Enhancements

* I added the `--long` (`-l`) flag to the `check` command and its subcommands to be able to see detailed report even if the check is OK.

## v1.3.0 (18.06.2018)

### Enhancements

* Now you can specify several paths when describing a bundle file. It's useful for those files which names are different in different DC/OS versions.
